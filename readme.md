## Same Case ##
For the same case, I first thought of using two pre-defined arrays containing the letters from a-z both lower and upper case but I remembered that the data type String has properties such as the ***match()***, or ***search()*** property but it doesn't return the values **true** or **false** luckily MDN has a very neat documentation that also shows related topics so I tried using regex alongside the ***test()*** property of RegExp.

## String Cleaning ##
For the string cleaning, I faced a somehow similar problem once where I had to remove a specific character within a text wherein I used the ***replace()*** property, so I just used the same code that I did for this problem with regex.
